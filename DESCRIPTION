Description: Provides methods for Bayesian spatial factor analysis using latent 
 spatial factors. The implementation is written in Julia and uses 
 nearest-neighbor Gaussian process approximations, sparse matrix computations, 
 and iterative solvers to enable scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. 
 It integrates R-based spatial utilities for spatial ordering and neighbor 
 selection.
